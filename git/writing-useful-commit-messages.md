# Writing useful commit messages

(There are many ideas about how to write commit messages, but this is mine.)

I generally credit [Matt Robinson](https://twitter.com/mmrobins) with pointing me in the direction of writing good (by which I mean useful and meaningful) commit messages. I don't _think_ I wrote "update", "fixed" sorts of messages before his lightning talk, but I definitely wrote fuller messages after the lightning talk.

Recently, I came across Chris Beams's "How to Write a Git Commit Message" and took special note of the section on [using imperative mood for commit message subjects](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative).

> **A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:**
>
> If applied, this commit will *your subject line here*   
>
> For example:
>
> If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability

I like this idea a lot, so I'm giving it a go in my own side projects and will definitely try it out in a work-setting as the opportunity arises.
