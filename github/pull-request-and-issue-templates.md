# Pull Request & Issue templates

PR & issue templates are a wonderful thing for a team with more than a couple of developers. Instead of having potentially infinity styles, you get consistently organized information customized for your team or organization's needs. :heart_eyes:

## Examples!

* The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a template for both PRs and issues:
 * https://github.com/cfpb/development/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
 * https://github.com/cfpb/development/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
 * I am somewhat biased in favor of these as I was tipped off about them by @jimmynotjim and used the PR template as the basis for a template at my new job. :grin:
