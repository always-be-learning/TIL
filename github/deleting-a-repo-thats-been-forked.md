# Deleting a repo that's been forked

I was wondering today what would happen to a repo, `dotsara/peggy-carter`, that's a fork of another repo, `peggy-carter`.

So I tried it!

I mean, _sure_, [GitHub explains what happens](https://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility/), but I wanted to _know_, y'know?

1. In another GitHub account, I created a repo, `peggy-carter`, adding a second commit.
2. From this GitHub account, I forked `peggy-carter` to `dotsara/peggy-carter`, then added a new commit

3. I went back to `peggy-carter` and deleted it.
4. Came back to `dotsara/peggy-carter` to see fork-flag gone and renamed it `agent-carter` :sunglasses:

Sweet!
