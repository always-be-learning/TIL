# You should probably be using `rel=noopener` on your links

Learned about this one from @stickel: [Random Interesting Facts on HTML/SVG usage: target=_blank w/ or w/o rel=noopener](https://css-tricks.com/random-interesting-facts-htmlsvg-usage/#article-header-id-6)

>43,924,869 of the anchors we analyzed are using target="_blank" without a rel="noopener" conjunction. In this case, if rel="noopener" is missing, you are leaving your users open to a phishing attack and it's considered a security vulnerability.

Noted!
